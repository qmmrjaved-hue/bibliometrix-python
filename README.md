## Overview

**bibliometrix-python** is a Python implementation of the renowned **bibliometrix** R package, providing a comprehensive set of tools for quantitative research in bibliometrics and scientometrics.

This project reimplements the core functionality of [bibliometrix](https://github.com/massimoaria/bibliometrix) (developed by Massimo Aria and Corrado Cuccurullo) using Python and the Shiny for Python framework, making these powerful bibliometric tools accessible to the Python scientific community.

Bibliometrics applies quantitative analysis and statistics to scientific publications and their citation patterns. It has become essential across all scientific fields for evaluating growth, maturity, leading authors, conceptual and intellectual maps, and emerging trends within research communities.

**bibliometrix-python** supports scholars in three key phases of analysis:

- **Data importing and conversion** from major bibliographic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Dimensions, Lens, Cochrane)

- **Bibliometric analysis** of publication datasets, including descriptive statistics, author productivity, and source impact

- **Building and visualizing networks** for co-citation, coupling, collaboration, and co-word analysis

## biblioshiny: Python Edition

**bibliometrix-python** includes an interactive web application built with **Shiny for Python**, providing an intuitive interface for comprehensive bibliometric analysis.

The web application enables scholars to easily access bibliometric analysis features through an interactive workflow:

## ETL Pipeline Extension (AY 2025/2026)

This fork extends `bibliometrix-python` with a fully source-agnostic ETL pipeline that
replicates `convert2df()` from the R Bibliometrix package. All output conforms to the
**WoS Field Tag schema**, making it compatible with every analytical function in
`www/services/` and `www/functions/`.

### Supported Sources

| Source | Format | Retrieval |
|---|---|---|
| PubMed | MEDLINE / E-utilities API | Automated (API) |
| OpenAlex | REST API (JSON) | Automated (API) |
| Scopus | CSV export | File upload |
| Scopus | BibTeX export | File upload |
| Web of Science | TXT / CIW plaintext | File upload |

| Dimensions | CSV / XLSX export | File upload |
| Lens.org | CSV export | File upload |
| Cochrane CDSR | TXT plaintext | File upload |
| PubMed | MEDLINE TXT file export | File upload |

---

### Architecture

Each pipeline phase is a dedicated module — monolithic functions are strictly prohibited.

| Module | Phase | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `www/services/mapping_dicts.py` | Config | 10 source mapping dicts; `MANDATORY_COLUMNS`, `LIST_FIELDS`, `SCALAR_FIELDS` |
| `www/services/api_retriever.py` | Extract (API) | `fetch_pubmed()`, `fetch_openalex()` — pagination, exponential-backoff retry |
| `www/services/standardizer.py` | Extract (file) + Transform | `load_file()`, `detect_source()`, `rename_columns()`, `enforce_types()`, `handle_nulls()`, `add_calculated_fields()`, `run_pipeline()` |
| `www/services/validator.py` | Validate | `validate(df)` — raises `ValidationError` naming the failing column; returns structured report |
| `dashboard/app.py` | Present | Streamlit dashboard (five tabs: API Query, File Upload, Validation, Analysis, About) |
| `tests/test_etl.py` | Test | pytest suite covering all pipeline phases and all 10 source types |

---

### Mapping Strategy

Column names are **never hardcoded** anywhere in the pipeline code.
`mapping_dicts.py` contains one dictionary per source that maps source-native field
names to WoS Field Tags. The dispatcher in `standardizer.py` selects the correct
dictionary automatically.

Selected mappings:

| Source | Example mapping |
|---|---|
| PubMed API | `FAU` → `AF`, `MH` → `ID`, `DP` → `PY`, `TA` → `JI` |
| OpenAlex API | `display_name` → `TI`, `cited_by_count` → `TC`, `author_names` → `AU` |
| Scopus CSV | `EID` → `UT`, `Cited by` → `TC`, `Author Keywords` → `DE` |
| Scopus BibTeX | `author` → `AU`, `note` → `TC` (Cited by: N), `url` → `UT` (EID) |
| WoS BibTeX | `ID` → `UT`, `keywords-plus` → `ID`, `times-cited` → `TC` |
| Dimensions | `Publication ID` → `UT`, `PubYear` → `PY`, `MeSH terms` → `ID` |
| Lens.org | `Lens ID` → `UT`, `Author/s` → `AU`, `Citing Works Count` → `TC` |
| Cochrane | `ID` → `UT`, `YR` → `PY`, `KY` → `DE`, `DOI` → `DI` |
| PubMed file | `IP` → `IS`, `IS` → `SN`, `LID` → `DI`, `PMID` → `PMID` |

All 10 sources pass through the **same** downstream `enforce_types` / `handle_nulls` /
`add_calculated_fields` pipeline — zero duplicated transform logic.

---

### Type Contracts

| Field | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `AU`, `AF`, `C1`, `CR`, `DE`, `ID` | `list[str]` | Split on `;`; `[]` if missing |
| All other scalar fields | `str` | `""` if missing |
| `PY` | `str` | 4-digit year extracted from full date string |
| `TC` | `int` | `0` if missing or unparseable |
| `DB` | `str` | Set from `SOURCE_TO_DB` map (e.g. `SCOPUS_CSV` → `"SCOPUS"`) |
| `SR` | `str` | Computed by existing `SR(M)` in `metatagextraction.py` |

Mandatory output columns (24):
`DB`, `UT`, `DI`, `PMID`, `TI`, `SO`, `JI`, `PY`, `DT`, `LA`, `TC`, `AU`, `AF`,
`C1`, `RP`, `CR`, `DE`, `ID`, `AB`, `VL`, `IS`, `BP`, `EP`, `SR`

---

### SR Field

The Short Reference field is computed by calling the existing `SR(M)` function
from `www/services/metatagextraction.py`. It is **never reimplemented** — the
ETL pipeline calls it directly from `add_calculated_fields()`, with a faithful
fallback for environments where Shiny-specific deps are absent.

---

### Patches Applied to Existing Code

Six patches were applied in place to accept all new DB values. Every patch is
marked with a `# PATCHED:` comment giving the reason.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `www/services/histnetwork.py` | Added `"WOS"` to the `Web_of_Science` branch; added `"SCOPUS"` to the Scopus branch; added `"DIMENSIONS"`, `"LENS"`, `"COCHRANE"` routed through WoS citation analysis |
| `www/services/biblionetwork.py` | Fixed `db_name == "SCOPUS"` case-sensitivity bug (was never matching); added `"wos"` to WoS branch in `label_short()`; added `"dimensions"`, `"lens"`, `"cochrane"` alongside `"pubmed"` / `"openalex"` |
| `www/services/metatagextraction.py` | Added `"SCOPUS"`, `"DIMENSIONS"`, `"LENS"`, `"COCHRANE"` to the `AU_UN` C3 institution-name override check |

---

### Running the ETL Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

The dashboard has five tabs:

1. **API Query** — enter a query, choose PubMed or OpenAlex, set result count, click Run Pipeline
2. **File Upload** — upload a bibliographic file (auto-detected or format selected), click Process File
3. **Validation** — per-check pass/fail status for the most recent pipeline run
4. **Analysis** — summary metrics, publications-per-year chart, top authors, top keywords
5. **About** — architecture description, supported sources, mandatory columns, patch table

---

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests only (no network, no file I/O)
pytest tests/test_etl.py -m "not integration and not file_sources"

# File-source tests (requires sources/ directory)
pytest tests/test_etl.py -m "file_sources"

# Full suite including live API calls
pytest tests/test_etl.py

# Verbose output
pytest tests/test_etl.py -v
```

---

### Data Output

Standardized CSVs are written to `data/outputs/`. Multi-value fields use `;`
as delimiter, matching the format expected by all analytical functions in
`www/services/` and `www/functions/`.
